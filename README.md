## OVERVIEW
May it be lunch, dinner or your late-night dessert cravings, enjoying your favorite food now is as easy as opening an app, selecting the dishes, placing your order and waiting for it to be delivered at your doorstep in no time!
<br>
Online food delivery applications are the need of the hour, not only to satisfy the consumers’ long ranging preferences and requirements, but also to significantly boost the businesses of the restaurants while catering a larger customer base.
<br>
Any service that enables clients to order food from restaurants or other food establishments and have it delivered to their location is referred to as a food delivery system. The use of technology has increased the effectiveness, accessibility, and convenience of food delivery for customers while giving restaurants the chance to expand their client base.


## PROBLEM STATEMENT/IDEATION

Many restaurants deal with inefficiencies in their delivery operations despite the rising demand for meal delivery services. Dissatisfied consumers and lower sales are caused by lengthy waits, wrong orders, lost, or damaged food. The solution should provide real-time updates on the status of food deliveries, streamline the ordering and delivery of food, cut down on customer wait times, boost customer happiness, and lower operational expenses for restaurants by offering a dependable and effective food delivery system. In addition, the system will offer insightful data analytics to support restaurants in making strategic business decisions.

## OBJECTIVES

1. To build a robust system for food delivery
2. To manage real-time orders and apply necessary coupons if required
3. To streamline the entire flow from order placement to delivery
4. To analyze and derive insights on the popularity of food items, and/or popular
restaurants.
5. To find interesting avenues in terms of restaurant sales and customer acquisition
6. To implement secure payment processing and cater multiple payment methods
